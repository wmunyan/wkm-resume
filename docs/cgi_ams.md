## General Description
In my two stints at CGI-AMS (interrupted by a short term blip at a failed startup - hey, it was 2000, everyone worked at a failed startup in 2000), I progressed from an entry-level PowerBuilder developer through to expert level, and was introduced to Java programming for the first time.  The majority of my PowerBuilder development was for a set of applications that functionally performed similar jobs, and were related in their base code. For all intents and purposes, they can be considered together; as environmental policy-related permitting, monitoring, and documentation applications. These software allowed for data entry of chemical and environmental data, performed the necessary calculations, and generated permitting documents for use by state-level environment departments, such as those in NJ, KY, MS, and petrochecmical companies such as Shell and Chevron.

## ProSteward/NJEMS/TEMPO
The ProSteward application was my first foray into professional programming out of college.  Within this project, I was responsible for a number of development tasks:

- Data Modeling using PowerDesigner
- Database stored procedure and trigger development
- Application programming using PowerBuilder

As I progressed in my time at CGI-AMS, I supported technical team leads, led small teams, and assisted project managers in development estimation, demos, and software builds. I was responsible for a number of major releases of the NJEMS/TEMPO software across state government client, such as New Jersey, Mississippi, Kentucky, and Tennessee.  Within this time, my programming experience expanded to Java, as is noted in the project work below.

## Other Project Work
During my time at CGI-AMS, I was fortunate to work on a number of Java-based projects, either as an individual contributor or the lead technical resource.

### Emissions Inventory Workbooks
The Emissions Inventory Workbooks project involved the automation of importing Excel-based emissions inventory data. The project utilized many open-source tools including the Spring Framework, iBatis, Quartz, XML, XSL, JAXB and Tomcat.

### National Emissions Inventory
The National Emissions Inventory process extracted air pollutant information from an Oracle database and utilized a Java-based procedure to generate XML documents for submission to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

### Nightly Cycle Processing
Nightly Cycle processes were batch routines developed in Java, designed to perform numerous tasks associated with environmental management system data.

### Interim Data Exchange Format
The IDEF process extracted discharge monitoring report information from environmental management systems for submission to the federal EPA.
