## General Description
While at BearingPoint, and later at CMA (the project was acquired from BearingPoint by CMA), I performed as the technical lead for the New York Early Intervention System (NYEIS) project. NYEIS was effectively a case management system used by the NY Department of Health to aid families requiring assistance for developmentally challenged youth. The Early Intervention Program offers a variety of therapeutic and support services to eligible infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families.

NYEIS was constructed using a customizable commercial off-the-shelf software tool: Curam.  Curam is a Java-based application that utilizes UML models to generate database tables, classes, and interfaces.  Using the UML modeling and Curam's code generation, customizations can be made for specific software workflows.

During my time on the NYEIS project, I received training for and passed certification exams for both Curam Developer (technical) and Curam Professional (business/functional). As my breadth of knowledge increased my responsibilities grew to include:

- Responsibility for technical decision-making, development standards, and code reviews
- Full comprehension of the technical architecture of the NYEIS software
- Functional understanding of the software system overall, in order to facilitate design discussions
- Service layer development for various workflows in the system, such as Individual Family Service Plans (IFSPs)
- Web application user interface design and development using Curam User Interface Metadata (UIM) structure
- Database Administration, source control administration, build master, and deployment administrator
- Software development estimation, capacity planning, and change management
