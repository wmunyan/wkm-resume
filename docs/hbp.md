- Software Architect

## General Description
As a senior member of the Product Engineering group, I lead architecture modernization, microservice design, mentoring, and assisting product management determining engineering needs within the HBR practice.  I focus on a strategically significant "API first" approach, domain-driven design, and documenting architecture decision records.  During my tenure, I have contributed to the implementation of multiple HBR projects, including the HBR.org homepage redesign, a re-released HBR mobile application utilizing up-to-date architectural principles and practices and modern application frameworks.  A listing of my extensive project work with relevant technical details is provided below.

Additionally, my role affords the opportunity to "influence without authority", contributing to every organizational team assigned to the HBR group.  In this capacity, I help demonstrate the "why" surrounding the group's efforts, helping to translate product roadmaps to engineering teams, reviewing technical designs, and performing code reviews.  I have also introduced, presented, and curated a technical knowledge-sharing program to expose engineering and product teams to various projects across the organization, expand the breadth of experience, and increase visibility of methodologies, techniques, and implementations.

### Contributions
Led the backend implementation of multiple HBR projects and leadership for the migration of a legacy "monolith" application to a microservice architecture.

#### HBR.org Homepage Redesign
- Implemented a backend-for-frontend (BFF) architectural pattern to enable:
  - Secure content access, and
  - Response aggregation supporting complex structure of HBR.org homepage frontend
  - Addition of HBR Executive Hub providing exclusive content access targeted to C-Suite and Executive leadership roles.
- AWS Lambda@Edge functions used within CloudFront to enable A/B testing and traffic migration to new homepage experience

#### HBR Mobile Application
- Implemented a backend-for-frontend (BFF) architectural pattern to accomplish:
  - Secure integration with multiple backend microservices enabling:
	- User management,
	- Content access,
	- Search capabilities,
	- Subscription management,
	- Device management
  - Response aggregation and structure supporting data needs for frontend usage
- Recipient of “One HBP” award for mobile app work

#### Leader Profile
- Implemented a backend-for-frontend (BFF) architectural pattern to enable:
  - Retrieval of Leader Profile quizzes, 
  - Storage of quiz responses, 
  - Calculation of Leader Profile "Superpower" and associated "Focus Skills"
  - Inclusion of Leader Profile data in HBR User Profile

#### Secured Content Feeds
- Atom feeds of recently-published HBR articles
- Intent is to replace publicly-accessible feedburner access to HBR digital content

#### Beta Program Management
- Application, used to manage HBR applications that can be deployed to certain sets of users.  Features include:
  - Dynamic restrictions to access applications in beta
  - Administrator management to create new beta programs and configure access restrictions
  - User management to allow HBR users to opt-into or out of participation in beta programs
- Implemented administrative software to assist synchronization of HBR subscriber account information between external partners
