## General Description
As a senior member of the Product Engineering group, I lead architecture modernization, microservice design, mentoring, and assisting product management determining engineering needs within the HBR practice.  I focus on a strategically significant "API first" approach, domain-driven design, and documenting architecture decision records.  During my tenure, I have contributed to the implementation of multiple HBR projects, including the HBR.org homepage redesign, a re-released HBR mobile application utilizing up-to-date architectural principles and practices and modern application frameworks.  A listing of my extensive project work with relevant technical details is provided below.

Additionally, my role affords the opportunity to "influence without authority", contributing to every organizational team assigned to the HBR group.  In this capacity, I help demonstrate the "why" surrounding the group's efforts, helping to translate product roadmaps to engineering teams, reviewing technical designs, and performing code reviews.  I have also introduced, presented, and curated a technical knowledge-sharing program to expose engineering and product teams to various projects across the organization, expand the breadth of experience, and increase visibility of methodologies, techniques, and implementations.
